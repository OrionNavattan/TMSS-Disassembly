Thoroughly labeled and commented disassembly of the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis Trademark Security System bootrom  
targeting ASM68K; reworked from the SNASM68k-based disassembly by moxniso: https://github.com/moxniso/tmss  
Builds bit perfect to dumps of the ROM other than the 14 KB of zeros added as hardware padding.

Thanks to CVGHiveBrain for the VDP register constants and inspiration for the styling.
